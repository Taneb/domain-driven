-- the return type.
--
-- When implementing the handler you have access to IO, but in order for the library to
-- ensure thread safety of state updates you do not have direct access to the current
-- state. Instead the handler returns a continuation, telling the library how to perform
-- the evaluations on the model.
--
-- The resulting events will be applied to the current state so that no other command can
-- run and generate events on the same state.
